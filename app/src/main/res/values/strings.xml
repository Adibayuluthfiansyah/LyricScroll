        [Intro]
        \n
        Advertise in imaginative ways, start your free trial today Come on in, the waters lovely Look, you could meet someone you like During the meteor strike, it is that easy Lunar surface on a Saturday night, dressed up in silver and white With coloured Old Grey Whistle Test lights
        \n
        Take it easy for a little while Come and stay with us, it’s such an easy flight Cute new places keep on popping up Since the exodus, its all getting gentrified I put a taqueria on the roof, it was well reviewed Four stars out of five And thats unheard of
        \n
        [Verse 2]
        \n
        Mr. Bridge and Tunnel on the Starlight Express The head of special effects in my mind’s eye Hokey Cokey with the opposite sex The things you try to forget, doesnt time fly? Im in no position to give advice, I dont want to be nice And you know that
        \n
        [Chorus]
        \n
        Take it easy for a little while Come and stay with us, its such an easy flight Cute new places keep on popping up Around Clavius, its all getting gentrified The Information-Action Ratio is the place to go And you will not recognise the old headquarters See upcoming rock shows Get tickets for your favorite artists You might also like ​euphoria Kendrick Lamar Tranquility Base Hotel Casino Arctic Monkeys Not Like Us Kendrick Lamar

        [Bridge]
        \n
        All the nights that never happened and the days that dont exist At the Information-Action Ratio The only time that we stop laughing is to breathe or steal a kiss I can get you on the list for all the clubs I can lift you up another semitone
        \n
        [Chorus]
        \n
        Take it easy for a little while (Take it easy for a little while) Come and stay with us, its such an easy flight Cute new places keep on popping up (Cute new places keep on popping up) Since the exodus, it’s all getting gentrified The Information-Action Ratio (The Information-Action Ratio) Is the place to go, four stars out of five Take it easy for a little while (Take it easy for a little while) Come and stay with us, now, it’s such an easy flight Cute new places keep on popping up (Cute new places keep on popping up) Around Clavius, its all getting gentrified I put a taqueria on the moon (The Information-Action Ratio) It got rave reviews, four stars out of five
        \n
        [Outro]
        \n
        Take it easy for a little while (Take it easy for a little while) Come and stay with us, four stars out of five Take it easy for a little while (Take it easy for a little while) Come and stay with us, four stars out of five Take it easy for a little while (Take it easy for a little while) Come and stay with us, four stars out of five Take it easy for a little while (Take it easy for a little while) Come and stay with us, four stars out of five (Take it easy for a little while) Four stars out of five</string>
